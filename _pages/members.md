### Javier Blanco Portillo | phd candidate
##### [personal website](https://javierbioblanco.github.io) | [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=4bo4uK8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)

<p> I'm a 5th year Biology PhD candidate working under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Feldman and <a href="https://ai-page.org">Prof. Alexander Ioannidis</a></b>. Funded by <b><a href="https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf">Stanford's Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship (SIGF)</a>, my current interests are:</p>
		<p> <span>&#8226;</span> To expand upon our historical analysis of Polynesian settlement patterns, incorporating these insights into precision medicine strategies tailored to admixed minority populations who remain underrepresented in modern genomic databases.</p>
		<p> <span>&#8226;</span> To extend the study of gene-culture coevolution, leveraging datasets across diverse disciplines to illuminate the dynamic relationships between genes, culture, and ecology.</p>
		<p> <span>&#8226;</span> To help understand the evolution of languages by borrowing techniques from population genetics.</p>

### Kaleda Denton | postdoc
##### [twitter](https://twitter.com/KaledaDenton) | [google scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=BycE1LoAAAAJ&hl=en)

I am a postdoc in the Feldman lab. My research focuses on the cultural evolution of conformist and anti-conformist transmission, and gene-culture co-evolution of altruism. I received my Bachelor of Science in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution from UCLA in 2014. There, I researched foraging behaviors in ants, birdsong syntax, and human morality. I am supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.
